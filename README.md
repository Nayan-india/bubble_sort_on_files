# bubble_sort_on_files
Bubble Sort files having 1000 to 10000 numbers, to find Time Complexity

### random_number_file_generator.c 
Generates 10 text (.txt) files having random numbers ranging from 1000 to 10000 in seperate files.

### bubble_sort_on_n_number_file.cpp
This code takes all the numbers from each file at a time and sort's them in ascending order. Meanwhile, it keeps record of cpu time to calculate the time taken by each file to get sorted. By taking cpu clock diffrence, of cpu clock before sorting a file and after sorting a file.
